# PARKING NOW

Parking Now is a web application developed to facilitate mobility and parking in the city of Medellín, providing a platform for people looking for parking spaces and for those who want to generate income by renting out their parking spots.


## FAQ

### Why?

When there’s an important event or when you visit a part of the city that you’re not familiar with, finding a nearby parking space can become a stressful and time-consuming task. The search for a suitable parking space often involves unnecessary circling, which not only increases stress and fuel consumption but can also lead to unsafe situations where the driver is forced to leave their vehicle in an unknown or unreliable area.

On the other hand, there are many places with parking spaces that are not being used efficiently. Owners of small residences, buildings, or residential units with vacant parking spots could be missing out on opportunities to generate additional income. Meanwhile, owners of formal parking facilities may struggle to maintain consistent occupancy due to a lack of visibility or competition.

That’s where we come in! We connect drivers searching for convenient parking spaces with parking owners looking to maximize their assets. Our platform makes it easy for you to find the perfect spot or rent out your unused parking, creating a win-win solution for everyone involved. Join us in transforming the parking experience today!

### What's the goal?

We want to enhance the experience for drivers searching for parking, allowing them to quickly and securely find and reserve parking spaces. At the same time, the platform aims to maximize the use of parking spaces, enabling owners to generate additional income and maintain consistent occupancy.

### For who?

#### For Users: 
The app allows drivers to quickly and securely find, reserve, and pay for a parking space, using geolocation technology to locate the nearest options. This significantly reduces search time and provides peace of mind by enabling them to park in a safe and reliable place.

#### For Parking Spot Owners: 
Parking Now offers a platform to maximize the use of their parking spaces. They can easily list their services, maintaining a constant demand and ensuring additional income. Even those with underutilized parking spaces, such as small residences or residential units, can easily rent them out through the platform, generating income securely.

Parking Now not only enhances the parking experience for drivers but also optimizes the use of available parking spaces in the city, benefiting both users and providers.
